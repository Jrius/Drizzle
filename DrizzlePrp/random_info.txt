******************** Quabs **************
quabObjects contains all the quab spawns in the prp file (there's 23)
SDLQuabs is the string name of the SDL var that counts the number of quabs not sunk.(default=20)

quabList has all the quabObjects appended at OnFirstUpdate
byteQuabs is the local value of the SDL var, and it's always kept in sync

OnServerInitComplete calls the timer which registers for SDL notification & byteQuabs is initially set to the SDL value.
  the SDL var defaults to 20
  if there are some number of quabs, calls ISPawnQuabs, which randomly loads only byteQuabs quabs from quabList
    it gets the quab's key, calls PtLoadAvatarModel on it, and saves the key to quabKeyList.

Whenever the SDL changes, it just updates the local value of byteQuabs but doesn't do anything else.

when the age unloads, it calls PtUnloadAvatarModel on each key in quabKeyList

if a quab collides with the deadzone object, we set the SDL to byteQuabs-1.

Summary: Get SDL number of quabs(default 20) and randomly loads that number.  Reduce SDL number of quabs when one is sunk.  When you quit, unload the ones you loaded.

Problem: other players may have loaded some, And you'll see those too, and everyone's who came before you.  But you won't see anyone's who come after you.

Solution: Don't load any quabs if the Age is already running.  Perhaps we could check to see if there's any other avatars(quabs included) before loading ours.
  Use len(PtGetPlayerList()) to find out if you're alone.  0 means you're alone.

Changing the quat around didn't seem to fix it.
Perhaps it's a difference between havok and physx, and the cones were changed to cut down on network traffic.
