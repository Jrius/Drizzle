Myst5/Crowthistle seem to have a number of differences with Python, compared to Pots/Moul.
the top part is the same.
the glue part is the same.

OnAgeDataInitialized(self) -> OnFirstUpdate(self) (this should probably be OnServerInitComplete, since Myst5 also has OnFirstUpdate).
There is no OnServerInitComplete in Myst5, as there's no server.
OnPlayerSpawned(self) -> OnAvatarSpawn(self, null) (check that it's the local avatar.)
OnEventCallback(self, event, userData) doesn't seem to be in Pots.
OnTimer(self, id) is the same
OnNotify(self, state, id, events) is the same
OnSDLNotify(self, notifierVar, changedVar, changeType) has another argument in Pots: the playerID
OnDefaultKeyCaught(self, keycode, keydown, param3, param4, param5) doesn't appear to be in Pots. (used by xCamToggler, so it probably doesn't matter.)
OnPythonNotifyMsg(self, data, target, senderKey) doesn't seem to be in Pots. (used by xCamToggler, for example).
OnBackdoorMsg(self, target, param) is the same.

//some more from Myst5 that I haven't gone through.
OnLinkFX(self, linkingIn, starting) (e.g. dsntquake.py)
OnFirstUpdate(self) is the same.
OnGUINotify(self, id, control, event, extraData)
OnControlKeyEvent(self, controlKey, activeFlag)
OnInit(self)
OnAgeDataLoaded(self) (e.g. lakicreates)
OnPlayerisBirdSpawned(self) (e.g. lakicreatures)
OnPageLoad(self, what, who)
OnReload(self)
OnVerifyCondition(self, key)
OnMovieEvent(self, movie, reason)
OnScreenCaptureDone(self, image)
