The bouncycastle.org license is MIT.
The jetty license is LGPL/GPL/Apache2.0/X11-like
  The readme files say that the javax.servlet classes are CDDL1.0, but Sun has also made them GPLv2+classpathException.
  Consequently all licenses are compatible(the classpath exception allows us to make this project GPLv3+ even though the javax.servlet classes are GPLv2).
The javax.servlet classes are GPLv2, but with a classpath exception, so we can freely use them.
The apache commons-math license is Apache2.0
The SevenZip stuff license is LGPL.
The Antlr runtime source is under a BSD license.
The Jbdiff code is under a BSD license.
The H2 code is under a modified MPL1.1 or EPL1.0 (at your choice), which cannot directly be mixed with GPL code, but our use of it is fine.
The Jacksum code is GPLv2+.
The Lpg code is EPL, which cannot be directly mixed with GPL code, but our use of it is fine.
The java-diff-utils code is Apache2.0.

All other files are GPLv3 or later, as noted at the start of each file.
