This project will package another project's jar, extract it at runtime(to the temp folder), execute it, then delete it when closing.

To use it, simple copy DrizzlePrp.jar to the "drizzle" package.  When you build it, it should be included.
If you use a jar other than DrizzlePrp.jar, just change it in Main.java.
